## Overview

This internship focuses on developing and demonstrating your data science skills through practical tasks. Each task will involve different aspects of data science, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and model building.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

1. **Goal**: Classify iris flowers into different species based on their features.
2. **Dataset**: Iris dataset (provided as `Iris Flower.xlsx`).
3. **Steps**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Visualize the dataset.
   - Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
   - Evaluate the model and save it for future predictions.

### Task 2: Spam Email Detection

1. **Goal**: Classify emails as spam or not spam using text data.
2. **Dataset**: Spam email dataset (provided as `Spam Email Detection.xlsx`).
3. **Steps**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Convert text data to TF-IDF features.
   - Train a Naive Bayes classifier.
   - Evaluate the model and visualize the results.

### Task 3: Time Series Forecasting

1. **Goal**: Forecast future values using time series data.
2. **Datasets**: Alcohol sales and miles traveled datasets (provided as `Alcohol_Sales.csv` and `Miles_Traveled.csv`).
3. **Steps**:
   - Load and preprocess the datasets.
   - Visualize the time series data.
   - Train ARIMA and Prophet models.
   - Evaluate the models and visualize the forecasts.

### Task 4: Unemployment Rate Analysis

1. **Goal**: Analyze and compare unemployment rates before and during COVID-19.
2. **Datasets**: Unemployment data (provided as `Unemployment in India.xlsx` and `Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.xlsx`).
3. **Steps**:
   - Load and preprocess the datasets.
   - Visualize the unemployment rates over time.
   - Calculate mean unemployment rates before and during COVID-19.
   - Compare and interpret the results.
